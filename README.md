This "Battleship game", was a school assignment of a group of two.  

The UI was built using Java Swing.

We implemented two types of game boards, with different ships and places. Here is how gameboard (1) is implemented:

• u-båt, 1 square = A
• torpedbåt, 2 squares = B
• jagare, 3 squares = C
• kryssare, 4 squares = D
• slagskepp, 5 squares = E
